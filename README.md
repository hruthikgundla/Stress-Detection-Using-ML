# Stress-Detection-Using-ML
This is a stress detection project we can determine the stress levels of user by Binary Values
stress detection project was developed that uses machine learning algorithms such as Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier and data cleaning techniques like STOPWORDS to detect and analyze stress levels in individuals.

The project involves collecting data from a variety of sources, including social media platforms, online forums, and surveys. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as STOPWORDS removal to remove irrelevant and commonly used words. This ensures that the data is relevant and useful for the analysis.

The Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm is used to classify the data into different categories based on the presence or absence of certain keywords and phrases. This allows the project to detect patterns and trends in the data, which can be used to identify potential stress triggers.

The project can also provide recommendations and resources for individuals who are experiencing stress based on their specific needs and circumstances. This can include advice on stress management techniques, resources for mental health support, and information on self-care practices.

# to make your own model using this repository follow the following steps:
- Firstly install python in your system

# install all the necessary libraries like:
 Numpy,
 Pandas,
 Sklearn,
 Scikit learn,
 matplotlib,
 nltk,
 stopwords,
 wordcloud
- Now import the code named in this file 
 run the file in jupyterNotebook
-And thats it you are pretty much done.
